# Tutorial — Complete Web Development Course Resources

> **IMPORTANT — READ THIS FIRST (How to download the ZIP)**
>
> **Do this before anything else:**
>
> 1. On the GitHub repo page, click the **green *Code* button** (top-right).
> 2. Select **"Download ZIP"** from the dropdown.
> 3. Save the ZIP file to your computer, then extract/unzip it.
> 4. Open the extracted folder in **VS Code** (`File → Open Folder...`) or simply open any `*.html` file in your browser.
>
> **Alternative (git):** if you prefer using Git, run:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/devabdisa/Tutorial.git
> ```
>
> ⚠️ I emphasise this step carefully because the ZIP download is the easiest way for most users to get all files (code, PPTs, PDFs, and other documents) at once.
